    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load data**  \n",
    "   - Uses `StatsBombLoader` (local open-data).  \n",
    "   - Selects Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 (2015/16).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert events → actions**  \n",
    "   - With SPADL (`convert_to_actions`, `add_names`).  \n",
    "   - Builds gamestates (previous 3 actions).  \n",
    "   - Standardizes play direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering**  \n",
    "   - Encodes action type, result, body part, start/end location, movement, time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Labels (VAEP)**  \n",
    "   - `VAEP = p(score in next 10 actions) - p(concede in next 10 actions)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train model**  \n",
    "   - Fit `XGBRegressor` on features to VAEP.  \n",
    "   - Learns how context + action features affect value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save output**  \n",
    "   - Saves model, feature columns, competitions, season info with `joblib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this, it will give you a different model every time because probability scores will change every time"
